This is not your average chain…  
This is your **manifestation ledger**, your **cosmic diary**, your **first step into the decentralized multiverse**.

- 💫 Visualize your blocks in a glowing, magical UI
- 🔍 Validate the integrity of the chain
- 💸 Add *fake* transactions (coming soon 👀)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python + Flask (backend)
- 🌐 HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (frontend)
- 🔮 Fireflies.js (for that ✨vibe✨)
